# Air Pollution Awareness App

This is a simple web application that fetches and displays the Air Quality Index (AQI) of a city entered by the user. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a local `data.json` file. The `data.json` file contains default data that the website uses to populate the AQI section dynamically when the page loads. This ensures users see meaningful information even before submitting a city name.

## Files Included

### 2. `style.css`

### 3. `script.js`

Contains the JavaScript logic to handle form submission, fetch AQI data, and update the page dynamically.

### 4. `data.json`

A sample JSON file that stores default data for the application.
